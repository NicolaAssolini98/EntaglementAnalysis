## Getting Started

This project only requires the `networkx` and `matplotlib` libraries to run.

- To test the prototype, execute the `main.py` file.

- `test/`: This folder contains test programs written in the described language. The files within follow the syntax of the defined grammar and serve to verify the functionality of the analyzer.

- `result.txt`: This file contains the results of the analysis performed on the test programs. Each program in the `test` folder has been processed, and the analysis results are reported in this file.

- `cfgs/`: This folder contains the Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) for each of the test programs. The graphs are saved in PNG format and visually represent the execution flow of the programs.

- `language.md` contains the specification of the language used to write test programs
